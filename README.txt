/*******************NOTES*******************/
There are two folders for mongodb scripts however there is really only the one
/mongodbscript contains a simple java program that replaces tabs with comma delimiters and inserts doublequotes around every data field. 
This is for mongoimport easily understand the file

/mongodbscripts is the same, except it also uses maven. Most git commits were done into this folder, however the end script for the repo
is more easily understood in /mongodbscript. This folder is kept only to show where the files were originally commited
